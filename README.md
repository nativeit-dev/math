# Math Experimentation and Exploration

Welcome to the Math Experimentation and Exploration repository! This repository is set up to provide a test bench for Python and Matlab experimentation and recreational exploration. It includes the popular "Manim" Python library from YouTube mathematician 3Blue1Brown for animating mathematical equations and models, as well as a number of examples pulled from 3Blue1Brown's series of YouTube videos.

## Features

- **Manim Library**: Animate mathematical equations and models using the Manim library.
- **Examples**: Explore various examples inspired by 3Blue1Brown's YouTube videos.
- **Python and Matlab**: Experiment with both Python and Matlab code.
